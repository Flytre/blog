I have two goals in writing this article:
* To help me commit to doing this
* To view this post in the future and see what I was up to in 2025


I've started writing a page of things I'm grateful for each day in a journal. The goal of this is to become a more appreciative and kinder person. My girlfriend has pointed out that I'm generally a very skeptical person and this journal aims to shift me to become more appreciate and complimentary. I also took a Scientology 'Oxford Capacity Analysis' test which measures how I view myself and my scores represent similar self-perception.

Hopefully this works out :)
